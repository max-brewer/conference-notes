## Memstate

* Your data fits in RAM

## The Memory Image Pattern - Fowler (Has many names, read the article on his blog)

By event sourcing you can rebuild the full application state by replaying the events in the system.

Also look at Prevayler, Klaus Wuestefeld as Morpheus, System prevalence (Talk).

## Summary

* Memory data can be viewed as a state machine
* Commands are Inputs or Causes
* Events are Outputs or Effects
* Replicated State Machine

### Benefites

* Build faster systems faster - 100x/0.3x
* Modeling flexibility
* EAsier to test
* Easier to debug
* Time travel queries
* What-if queries
* Complete history of changes

## Origo DB

* IN-memory event-sourced application state engine
* ACID transactions
* 3k Commands/second
* OPen Source
* Blah, blah
