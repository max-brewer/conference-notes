## Reduce coupling

Look at things from a BDD bounded context buisness perspective.

Product does not have a price. Price is associated with an identifier of the product.
Samee with ratings.


### Queries

It all starts with a basic project and a view

View is verty basic. A specific viewmodel with all the data needed.
The controller is very skinny. It has no code for retrieving the model.

Requests are handled with a handler. Presumably it is all implemented through middleware. - It is.
The viewmodel is dynamic. Properties are added through several handlers which may get their data from disinct sources.
Once all the handlers are returned, more middleware composes these into the end viewmodel.

Seems a good approach. Would need some resilience.
By splitting your API calls by bounded context you can control your caching at a much more granular level. As not all contexts will have the same freshness constraints, this can be a huge improvement.
