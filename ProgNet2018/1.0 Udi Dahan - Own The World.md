## Disconnect between product and project

## How to make good estimates

## Dealing with coupling

Be one with coupling. You can't avoid it. (I'm not convinced on this one)

### Discovering new boundaries.

For example, the star rating of a product is not necessarily part of the product its self. There is no reason to couple them at all. They are not directly related internally.
Same with the price. It doesn't need any knowledge of the product it's self, asside from a key. 

### Projects vs Products

* [Check handwritten notes]


### How to make good estimates

* Given a well formed team of size X.
* That isn't working on anything else.
* I'm Y% confident that it will take between T1 and T2 time.
* So you are ((100 - Y)/2)% confident of finishing before T1
