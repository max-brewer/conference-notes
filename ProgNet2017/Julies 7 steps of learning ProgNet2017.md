*You can still benefit from parts without being an expert*

Revise Bounded Contexts (Evans, DDD) - Julie rates it.
(maybe revise the whole book)

Try - Find something that you can learn deeply as a unit, but make it a small part of the whole.

Instead of asking 'is it possible to do x with y?'. Try it yourself and share the results. You might learn something.

Asking questions is not a sign of failure.

*Be clear to differentiate between fact, opinion and an educated guess*

> When someone asks me a question and I'm only 99% sure, I whip up a demo.
